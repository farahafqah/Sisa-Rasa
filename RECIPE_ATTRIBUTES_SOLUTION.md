# Recipe Attributes Data Quality Solution

## Problem Identified

The recipe recommendation system was displaying potentially misleading recipe attributes (prep time, cook time, servings, cuisine, difficulty) that appeared to be using default/hardcoded values instead of actual data from the recipe datasets.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Epicurious Dataset Processing**: While the dataset contained some real timing and cuisine data, the extraction logic was basic and didn't handle various time formats properly.

2. **Clean Dataset Processing**: All attributes were hardcoded to default values (30min prep, 45min cook, 4 servings, 'International' cuisine, 'Medium' difficulty).

3. **Frontend Enhancement**: The search results page was generating estimated values when backend data was missing, but wasn't clearly indicating these were estimates.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Data Extraction (`src/download_epicurious_dataset.py`)

**Added Helper Functions:**
- `extract_time_value()`: Parses various time formats including ISO 8601 duration (PT30M), natural language ("1 hour 30 minutes"), and numeric values
- `extract_cuisine()`: Extracts cuisine information from multiple recipe fields (cuisine, category, tags, keywords)

**Improved Processing:**
- Better parsing of prep/cook times from original dataset
- Enhanced servings extraction with reasonable bounds (1-12)
- More accurate cuisine detection from recipe metadata

### 2. Data Quality Indicators in API (`src/api/routes.py`)

**Backend Changes:**
- Added estimation flags for each attribute (`prep_time_estimated`, `cook_time_estimated`, etc.)
- Logic to detect when values are defaults vs. real data
- Pass estimation flags to frontend in API responses

### 3. Transparent UI Display (`src/api/templates/search-results.html`)

**Frontend Enhancements:**
- Added `getDisplayValue()` method to show estimated values with "~" prefix and "(est.)" label
- Updated recipe cards to display: "~30min prep (est.)" instead of "30min prep"
- Enhanced recipe detail modals with estimation indicators
- Added CSS styling for estimated labels (italic, muted color)

**Visual Indicators:**
- Estimated values show with tilde (~) prefix
- "(est.)" label in smaller, italic, muted text
- Consistent styling across recipe cards and detail modals

## Benefits

1. **Transparency**: Users now know when recipe attributes are estimated vs. actual data
2. **Data Quality**: Better extraction of real timing and cuisine data from Epicurious dataset
3. **User Trust**: Clear labeling prevents misleading users about recipe complexity/timing
4. **Functionality Preserved**: All filtering and sorting features continue to work
5. **Future-Proof**: Framework in place to improve data quality as better datasets become available

## Example Display Changes

**Before:**
- "30min prep" (misleading - appears as fact)
- "International" (generic default)

**After:**
- "~25min prep (est.)" (clearly estimated)
- "~Italian (est.)" (estimated but more specific)
- "45min prep" (actual data, no estimation label)

## Technical Details

### Estimation Detection Logic
```javascript
// Check if values are defaults (indicating estimation)
const prep_time_estimated = prep_time == 30;
const cuisine_estimated = cuisine == 'International';
```

### Display Logic
```javascript
getDisplayValue(value, isEstimated, suffix) {
  if (isEstimated) {
    return `~${value}${suffix} <span class="estimated-label">(est.)</span>`;
  }
  return `${value}${suffix}`;
}
```

## Files Modified

1. `src/download_epicurious_dataset.py` - Enhanced data extraction
2. `src/api/routes.py` - Added estimation flags to API responses
3. `src/api/templates/search-results.html` - Updated UI with estimation indicators

## Testing

The application has been tested and is running successfully with the new estimation indicators. Users can now:
- See clear labels for estimated vs. actual data
- Filter and sort recipes as before
- Make informed decisions based on data quality
- Trust the system's transparency about data limitations

## Future Improvements

1. **Better Datasets**: Source recipes from APIs with more complete metadata
2. **Machine Learning**: Predict missing attributes based on ingredients/instructions
3. **User Contributions**: Allow users to correct/verify recipe attributes
4. **Data Validation**: Add bounds checking and validation for extracted values
